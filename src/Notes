Install vite: npm i create vite@latest
Install Tailwindcss-vite: npm i tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite

Multi Page Install: npm i react-router-dom

"min-h-screen" in Tailwind means, Minimum height is 100vh(viewport height)
"px-6" means Padding at (X-axis = left + right)

1 - .25rem - 4px
2 - .50rem - 8px  So On....
6 - 1.50 rem - 24px

p-2 (But you not satisfied, want your own custom padding, therefore can use [])
p-[2px] (it will give 2px padding)

We will use <Link> tag from 'react-router-dom' instead of Anchor tag <a> for LOGO Image (because it's Fast)

For Icons: chrome(React Icons)

For State-Mangement: we will use Context API

-> createContext is used to create a Context object that stores global data and allows components to share values without passing props manually {Creates a global data store (Context) that can be shared across components (kind of inbuilt Redux in React)}
-> useContext is a hook that allows a component to read or access the data stored in a Context without using props {Allows a component to access the value provided by that Context.}

import.meta is a special built-in object in ES modules (meta = metadata)
